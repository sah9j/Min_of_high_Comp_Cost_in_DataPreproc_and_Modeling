name: Minimization of High Computational Cost in Data Preprocessing and Modeling Using
  MPI4Py
description: Data preprocessing is a fundamental stage in deep learning modeling and
  serves as the cornerstone of reliable data analytics. These deep learning models
  require significant amounts of training data to be effective, with small datasets
  often resulting in overfitting and poor performance on large datasets. One solution
  to this problem is parallelization in data modeling, which allows the model to fit
  the training data more effectively, leading to higher accuracy on large data sets
  and higher performance overall. In this research, we developed a novel approach
  that effectively deployed tools such as MPI and MPI4Py from parallel computing to
  handle data preprocessing and deep learning modeling processes. As a case study,
  the technique is applied to COVID-19 data from state of Tennessee, USA. Our results
  demonstrate promising outcome for the deployment of parallel computing in modeling
  to minimize high computational cost.
